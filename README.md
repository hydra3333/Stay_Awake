  <br>Stay_Awake
</h1>

A tiny Windows tray utility that keeps your computer **awake** (blocks sleep/hibernation) while still allowing the **display monitor to sleep**. Built with Python + tkinter; distributed as PyInstaller **onefile** and **onedir** builds.

## What it does (in plain English)

* While Stay\_Awake runs, it requests the OS to **not sleep/hibernate**. Your **display monitor can still sleep** normally if your power plan allows it.
* When you **quit** (or when an **auto-quit** timer fires), the app **releases** the request and your PC can sleep again.
* A small **windows system-tray icon** provides **Show Window** and **Quit**.
* The main window uses native-looking **ttk** controls; buttons are at the bottom.

## Key Features

* **Prevents system sleep/hibernation** while running; auto-restores normal behavior on exit.
* **System tray** icon with a simple menu (Show Window / Quit).
* **Minimize behavior:** both the title-bar **“\_”** and the **Minimize to System Tray** button minimise the app to the system-tray.
* **Close (X)** in the main window exits the app completely.
* **Icon / image priority** (for both the window and tray):

  1. `--icon PATH`** (explicit override)
  2. Embedded base64 in the pythin script which may be empty)
  3. A file named **`Stay_Awake_icon.*`** next to the EXE/script (PNG/JPG/JPEG/WEBP/BMP/GIF/ICO)
  4. A small internal fallback glyph (so it never crashes)

* **Auto-scaling image:** in the window into a square (by edge replication): longest side ≤ **512 px** .
* **Auto-quit:** keep awake for a fixed duration (`--for`) **or** until a specific local date/time (`--until`). The window shows:
* **Low-resource-use countdown:** updates window display less often when plenty of time remains; updates faster as it nears zero; **throttles** updates when the window is hidden; and **“snaps”** to neat time boundaries so it feels calm and rounded.
* **Display countdown shown:**
  * **Auto-quit at:** local ETA
  * **Time remaining:** `Xd HH:MM:SS` (days appear when applicable)
  * **Update cadence:** displays current update frequency of the timer in the window

## Command-line options

```text
--icon PATH
    Use a specific image file for the window/tray icon.
    Supports: PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, BMP, GIF, ICO.

--for DURATION
    Keep awake for a fixed time, then quit gracefully.
    DURATION accepts days/hours/minutes/seconds in the form of a single string (no spaces):
      3d4h5s, 2h, 90m, 3600s, 1h30m
    A bare number means minutes. Use 0 to disable the timer for maximum duration.
    Bounds: at least MIN_AUTO_QUIT_SECS (default 10s), at most MAX_AUTO_QUIT_SECS (default ~365 days).
    The app re-ceils the remaining time right before arming the timer, for accuracy.
    Mutually exclusive with --until.

--until "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    DATETIME in the form of a single quoted string, all field parts must be present.
    Keep awake until the given local **24-hour** timestamp, then quit gracefully.
    Examples (relaxed spacing & 1–2 digit parts accepted):
      "2025-01-02 23:22:21"
      "2025- 1- 2  3: 2: 1"
      "2025-1-2 3:2:1"
    Daylight Saving Time and local windows timezone are honored.
    Bounds: at least MIN_AUTO_QUIT_SECS in the future, at most MAX_AUTO_QUIT_SECS from now.
    Mutually exclusive with --for.
```

> **Notes**
>
> * `--for` and `--until` are **mutually exclusive**; provide only **one or the other**.
> * A small (±1s) variation near the very end can occur due to Windows timer jitter - this is normal.

### Examples

**Run for a fixed time**

```cmd
.\Stay_Awake.exe --for 2h
.\Stay_Awake.exe --for 45m
.\Stay_Awake.exe --for 3d4h5s
.\Stay_Awake.exe --icon ".\Stay_Awake_icon.png" --for 90m
```

**Run until a local date/time**

```cmd
.\Stay_Awake.exe --until "2026-01-02 23:22:21"
```

**Interesting one-liner using powershell (better doable via `--for`)**

* NOTE: .BAT (needs to double the % signs in `for`)

```bat
@echo off
@setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
@setlocal enableextensions
set "minutes_from_now=5"
for /f "usebackq delims=" %%T in (`powershell -NoProfile -Command "(Get-Date).AddMinutes(!minutes_from_now!).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')"`) do (
    set "datetime_ahead=%%T"
)
python ".\Stay_Awake.py" --until "!datetime_ahead!"
```

## Download & Run (Windows)

Each Release includes **three** ZIPs:

### 1) Onefile ZIP — single EXE (+ optional icon files)

* **What’s inside:** `Stay_Awake.exe` (and possibly `Stay_Awake_icon.*`).
* **Extract (Explorer):** Right-click ZIP -> **Extract All…** -> open the folder.
* **Extract (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path .\Stay_Awake_<ver>_windows_onefile.zip -DestinationPath .\Stay_Awake_onefile -Force
```
* **Run:** double-click `Stay_Awake.exe`.
  Optionally place `Stay_Awake_icon.*` alongside it to control the window/tray image.

> Tip: Don’t run from inside the ZIP viewer. Always extract first.

### 2) Onedir ZIP — full app folder (EXE + optional icon files + python runtime files in a subfolder)

* **What’s inside:** Stay_Awake.exe` (and possibly `Stay_Awake_icon.*`) at the ZIP root, python runtime files in a subfolder.
* **Important:** **extract everything** and keep the folder structure intact.
* **Extract (Explorer):** Right-click ZIP -> **Extract All…**
* **Extract (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path .\Stay_Awake_<ver>_windows_onedir.zip -DestinationPath .\Stay_Awake_onedir -Force
```
* **Run:** in the extracted folder, double-click `Stay_Awake.exe`.

> Tip: Don’t run from inside the ZIP viewer. Always extract first.

### 3) Source ZIP — run from Python (if Python 3.13+ and pip dependencies are installed)

* **What’s inside:** `Stay_Awake.py` (and optionally `Stay_Awake_icon.png`).
* **Install dependencies (after python 3.13+ installed):**
```cmd
pip install wakepy --no-cache-dir --upgrade --check-build-dependencies --upgrade-strategy eager --verbose
pip install pystray --no-cache-dir --upgrade --check-build-dependencies --upgrade-strategy eager --verbose
pip install Pillow  --no-cache-dir --upgrade --check-build-dependencies --upgrade-strategy eager --verbose
```
* **Run with console (to see debug info printed to the console):**
```cmd
python .\Stay_Awake.py
```

* **Run with no console:**
```cmd
pythonw .\Stay_Awake.py
```

* NOTE: CLI options (`--for`, `--until`, `--icon`) work the same as with the EXE.

## Behavior & Tips

* **Tray icon hidden?** It may be in the overflow area; show hidden icons or set “Always show all icons in the taskbar.”
* **Why didn’t my PC sleep?** While Stay\_Awake runs, DOS command `powercfg -requests` shows it under **SYSTEM**. Quit the app to release the block.
* **Minimize didn’t hide to windows system-tray?** Ensure you’re on the latest release; both **“\_”** and **Minimize to System Tray** hide to the windows system-tray.
* **ETA alignment & countdown:** the ETA shown in the window is computed from the exact target epoch (from `--until` or internally from `--for`). The countdown updates at low cadence far out (minutes), then faster as it nears the end, throttling further when the window is hidden to minimise CPU.
* **Exit codes:** normal exit returns 0; argument validation errors use a non-zero exit.

---

## Release Automation (GitHub Actions)

* On **Release -> Published**, the workflow builds **onefile** and **onedir**, zips them, lists ZIP contents, and attaches them to the release.
* ZIP names are derived from the **release tag** (sanitized).
* Any `Stay_Awake_icon.*` at the repo root are copied into both deliverables and the workflow prints exactly which icon files were included.
* The workflow also pre-builds a multi-size `Stay_Awake_icon.ico` for PyInstaller.

---

## Security / SmartScreen

Unsigned, freshly built executables can be flagged by Windows SmartScreen/Defender. If blocked:

* Review the python code yourself, then the github workflow build code, to ensure it is safe
* Click **More info -> Run anyway**, or
* Add an exclusion in Defender, or
* Submit a **false-positive** report to Microsoft or your antivirus provider.

> `onedir` is known to cause less false positives in lesser-known antivirus products than `onefile`

---

## Troubleshooting

* **No tray icon?** Show hidden icons or allow all icons in the taskbar.
* **Sleeps anyway?** Another power manager may override; check your power plan or OEM tools.
* **Auto-quit didn’t trigger exactly on the second?** A tiny (±1s) drift can occur due to timer jitter; the app uses a monotonic deadline to stay accurate overall.
