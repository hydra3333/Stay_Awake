# Stay_Awake

A lightweight system tray application that prevents your computer from going to sleep or hibernating while allowing the display to sleep for power savings.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration**: Runs quietly in the system tray with minimal resource usage
- **Prevents Sleep & Hibernation**: Keeps your system awake for long-running tasks
- **Allows Display Sleep**: Monitor can still turn off to save power
- **Clean Interface**: Simple main window with minimize and quit options
- **Multiple Exit Methods**: Window buttons, system tray right-click menu
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Restores normal power management on exit
- **Cross-platform**: Built with Python, works on Windows (with potential for other platforms)

## Antivirus False Positives

**Important Notice**: Some antivirus software may flag the executable as suspicious. This is a common false positive with PyInstaller-built applications.

**Why this happens:**
- PyInstaller bundles Python + libraries into a single executable
- The application prevents system sleep (legitimate functionality that malware also uses)
- Self-extracting executables can trigger heuristic detection

**The application is safe because:**
- All source code is publicly available in this repository
- Built using GitHub Actions (publicly visible build process)
- Uses only legitimate libraries: wakepy, pystray, tkinter, Pillow
- No network communication or data collection

**If your antivirus flags it:**
- Add an exception for Stay_Awake.exe
- Download and build from source using the provided instructions
- Check the GitHub Actions build logs to verify the build process

**VirusTotal Results**: Like many PyInstaller applications, this may show some false positives. The application contains no malicious code.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended)
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/Stay_Awake/releases) page
2. Download the latest `Stay_Awake.exe`
3. Run the executable - no installation required!

### Option 2: Run from Source
Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stay_Awake.git
cd Stay_Awake

# Install dependencies
pip install wakepy pystray Pillow

# Run the application
python Stay_Awake.py
```

### Option 3: Build Your Own Executable
```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install pyinstaller wakepy pystray Pillow

# Build the executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noconsole --name "Stay_Awake" Stay_Awake.py

# The executable will be in the dist/ folder
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run `Stay_Awake.exe` or `python Stay_Awake.py`
2. **Control Window**: The main window shows the current status
   - Click "Minimize to System Tray" to hide the window
   - Click "Quit" to exit the application
3. **System Tray**: Look for the eye icon in your system tray
   - **Left-click** the icon to show the main window
   - **Right-click** the icon for menu options (About, Quit)
4. **Window Behavior**: 
   - Both the close button (X) and minimize button (-) send the window to the system tray
   - Only the red "Quit" button or tray menu actually exits the application

## How It Works

Stay_Awake uses the `wakepy` library which calls the Windows `SetThreadExecutionState` API to inform the operating system that the application requires the system to stay awake. This is a lightweight, efficient method that:

- Uses virtually no CPU resources
- Doesn't interfere with other applications
- Automatically cleans up when the application exits
- Is the same method used by professional applications

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter (built into Python)
- **System Tray**: pystray library
- **Wake Management**: wakepy library
- **Icon Generation**: PIL/Pillow
- **Executable Generation**: PyInstaller

## Troubleshooting

**Icon not visible in system tray?**
- Check if your system tray is set to show all icons
- The icon appears as a black eye with radiating lines

**Application doesn't prevent sleep?**
- Make sure no other sleep-prevention software is conflicting
- Check Windows power settings aren't overriding the request
- Verify the application is running (check system tray)

**About dialog won't close?**
- This is fixed in version 1.1+, please update to the latest release

## System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later (primary target)
- **Memory**: Minimal (~10-20 MB RAM usage)
- **CPU**: Negligible impact when idle
- **Dependencies**: None for the executable version

**Note**: This application prevents automatic sleep/hibernation but does not prevent manual sleep (e.g., clicking Start â†’ Sleep). This is intentional behavior for user control.
